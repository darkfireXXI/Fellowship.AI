# Fellowship.AI
As part of the application for Fellowship.AI you have to submit a jupyter notebook tackling one of the problems listed on their website. I chose the Global Terrorism Database challenge. Using a data set recording over 180k terrorist attacks since 1970 one must use ML to determine which terrorist group was responsible for a given attack using factors like location, date, weapon, etc.  

The .ipynb file in this repository contains a well documented code I used to create a random forest to model the data. With pretty minimal effort I was able to obtain 82% accuracy and after playing with the data and adjusting the model parameters I ended up with 85% accuracy. While I am pleased with the result my final random forest only used 25 trees, relative to the 100 I was using for small sample tests. This was because my computer did not have the memory to model more, otherwise I would have and I'm sure I could have done marginally better just by using more trees.
